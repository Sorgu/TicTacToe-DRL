This project uses deep reinforcement learning to train a neural network to play tic-tac-toe.

The best model I made(1.12) and trained was able to get this result after playing against a bot that did random legal moves:
        Wins:          971
        Losses:        0
        Draws:         21
        Illegal moves: 8
The model uses a simple neural network consisting of Dense layers with Relu activations
